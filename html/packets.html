<td><a href = "PlayerAuthInputPacket.html">Player Auth Input</a></td>
<td>Added for Server Authoritative Movement to sync all player input with the server. See ServerAuthMovementMode for a description of the movement modes. This takes the place of the following packets from legacy client authoritative movement: - PlayerActionPacket (one-off actions) - PlayerInputPacket (vehicle control) - MovePlayerPacket (primary input) - MoveActorAbsolutePacket (positioning client authoritative vehicles) - PassengerJumpPacket (horse jumping) - AnimatePacket (boat row input and animation) The jump scale (progress bar for horse jumping) is computed like this: - Jump ticks start accumulating when `InputData::Jumping` is set in `PlayerAuthInputPacket` - Every following tick that `InputData::Jumping` is still set the jump ticks increase by 1 - The first tick that releases `InputData::Jumping` expects the jump to trigger, producing the same jump scale as was in `PassengerJumpPacket` using this formula floor((ticks < 10.0f ? ticks x 0.1f : 0.8f + (2.0f / (ticks - 9.0f)) x 0.1f) x 100.0)  Boat paddling determines the ActorDataIDs::ROW_TIME_LEFT and ROW_TIME_RIGHT like this: Every tick the row time is incremented on that side if it is paddling. Paddle input is determined in two different ways depending on input mode. 'Paddle force' mode is used if: - `PlayerAuthInputPacket::mInputMode` is anything other than `InputMode::Touch` - `PlayerAuthInputPacket::mPlayMode` is `ClientPlayMode::Reality` (VR) - `PlayerAuthInputPacket::mNewInteractionModel` is `NewInteractionModel::Touch` or `NewInteractionModel::Classic`  <b>Paddle force mode</b>  Paddle force uses the `PlayerAuthInputPacket::mMove` direction to paddle the boat relative to its orientation like in keyboard mode. Left will paddle the left oar meaning the boat turns right. This means the paddle state can be implied from `mMove`: - Left is paddling if `mMove.y` is nonzero or `mMove.x` is negative - Right is paddling if `mMove.y` is nonzero or `mMove.x` is positive  <b>Non paddle force mode</b>  - Left is paddling if `InputData::PaddlingLeft` is set - Right is paddling if `InputData::PaddlingRight` is set  <b>Adopting server authoritative movement protocol</b>  This packet can be used to implement client authoritative motion by blindly accepting the Player Position and Rotation values except for the caveat described in PlayerActionType::HandledTeleport. If they are riding a client predicted vehicle as determined by a previous SetActorLinkPacket from the server, the position and velocity is interpreted as the vehicle, not the player. If desired, the server can additionally simulate motion and send CorrectPlayerMovePredictionPackets rather than accepting client reported positions. The server may also reject the InputData state transitions usually by sending a corrective SetActorDataPacket, see the PlayerAuthInputPacket::InputData enum table for details. All tick values for client bound packets that have them should be written as specified in the documentation on PlayerInputTick.</td>
