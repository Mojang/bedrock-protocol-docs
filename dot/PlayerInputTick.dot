In server authoritative movement mode the client supplies this in PlayerAuthInputPacket.
For any client-bound packets containing a tick, the server should supply the tick value corresponding to the most recently processed PlayerAuthInputPacket.
This allows the client to adjust any client predictions made while the packet was in flight.
If the packet is being sent to the client but not relating to data of the player or a client-predicted vehicle, it can be zero.
It is also acceptable to specify zero for players, although this may lead to minor visual flickers and less smooth application of CorrectPlayerMovePredictionPacket.
