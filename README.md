# The Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Network Protocol Documentation

We share our Network Protocol with server partners so they can write their own Minecraft servers with their own code. This documentation compiles a series of tree diagrams that define the structure of the packets used by the Protocol, as well as related classes and enums.
Protocol is subject to change release over release.

Current Release - r/21_u5
