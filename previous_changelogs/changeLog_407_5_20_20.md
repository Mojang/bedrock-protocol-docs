## Packet changes:
My apologies, this is not an exhaustive list. Taking over the documentation system had issues.

### PlayerSkinPacket
	isTrustedSKin (bool) field

### StartGamePacket
	Added mEnableItemStackNetManager to end

### ActorLink
	added mRiderInitiated field: whether the link was changed by the reader

### CraftingDataPacket
	Now sends a net ID after the recipe (varint)

### CreativeContentPacket
	Note that a GroupInfo list was in the CreativeContent packet for a while, but has been temporarily removed. (Props to Youri Kersten for noticing.)

### HurtArmorPacket
	Now has a cause enum field before the damage amount

### InventoryContentPacket
	This is pretty much all-new; see Tyler Laing's doc on migrating to the new inventory system; you'll likely be using the legacy slots for now while we prepare the docs on how to migrate to the server auth system.

### InventoryTransactionPacket
	If has a legacy request id write a vector of LegacySetSlots (Container enum, vector of slots (bytes))

### PlayerSkinPacket
	IsTrustedSKin (bool) field

### SetSpawnPositionPacket
	Spawn block pos (NetworkBlockPosition) field

### StartGamePacket
